# PCB-NFC-Card
I designed and created a PCB business card, that features an NFC chip, a capacitor, a resistor, and an LED. When placed near a phone, the card lights up the LED and sends a link directly to the phone (Right now it leads people to my LinkedIn). I made this project to learn the basics on PCB Design and also because it seemed pretty fun :)

This project was then taught at a  workshop I organized at my high school's STEM Club, teaching over 100 students, some as young as 13, the basics of PCB design and electronics. Each student made their own PCB card based on mine with unique art and designs, and we had them shipped for free, removing the cost barrier that often limits access to hardware projects. Seeing students get excited about their first PCB and having some come to me with new ideas was incredibly rewarding. The goal was to make electronics accessible to high school students and provide a hands-on experience they wouldn't normally get in a traditional classroom setting.
